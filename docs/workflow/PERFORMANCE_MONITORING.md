# Performance Monitoring

This document outlines our approach to monitoring and improving performance in the SoundMaster Radio application.

## Performance Metrics

1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
   - First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
   - Interaction to Next Paint (INP): < 200ms

2. **Application-Specific Metrics**
   - Time to Interactive for Audio Player: < 1s
   - Audio Buffer Stall Rate: < 0.5%
   - API Response Times: < 200ms (95th percentile)
   - Time to First Meaningful Content: < 1.5s

## Monitoring Tools

1. **Lighthouse Audits**
   - Run regular performance audits
   - Track scores over time
   - Address issues identified in reports

2. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Monitor bundle size with `npm run analyze`
   - Track changes in bundle size over time
   - Set budget alerts for significant increases

   ```bash
   # Run bundle analyzer
   npm run analyze
   ```

3. **Real User Monitoring**
   - Implement RUM to track actual user performance
   - Segment by device type, connection speed, and region
   - Set up alerting for performance degradations

4. **Error Tracking**
   - Integration with error tracking service
   - Monitor for JavaScript errors
   - Track API failures and timeouts

## Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**
   - Simulate expected user load
   - Identify bottlenecks under heavy traffic
   - Test API endpoints for scalability

2. **Performance Regression Testing**
   - Compare performance metrics between releases
   - Automate performance checks in CI pipeline
   - Block merges that significantly degrade performance

## Performance Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Lazy load non-critical components
   - Implement progressive loading strategies

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Optimize images using modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Implement responsive images with srcset
   - Use font subsetting and display strategies

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Implement effective cache headers
   - Use service workers for offline support
   - Cache API responses appropriately

4. **Runtime Optimization**
   - Minimize React renders
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders with memoization
   - Optimize expensive calculations
   - Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Regular Performance Reviews**
   - Schedule monthly performance reviews
   - Compare against established baselines
   - Identify areas for improvement

2. **Performance Budgets**
   - Establish budgets for key metrics
   - Monitor for regressions
   - Include in code review process

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document performance optimizations
   - Share best practices with the team
   - Train developers on performance tools

# Feature Development Process

This document outlines our process for developing new features in the SoundMaster Radio application.

## Feature Development Cycle

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Understand the feature requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Clarify any questions with the product owner
   - Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks

2. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. **Test-Driven Development Approach**
   - Write tests first based on acceptance criteria
   - Implement the feature to make tests pass
   - Refactor code as needed while maintaining passing tests

4. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Follow our [coding standards](../best-practices/INDEX.md)
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Implement responsive designs
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include accessibility features

5. **Local Testing**
   - Run unit tests: `npm run test`
   - Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
   - Perform manual testing
   - Check for responsive behavior

6. **Code Commit Practices**
   - Commit regularly with descriptive messages
   - Follow Conventional Commits format
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add song search functionality"
   ```

7. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```
   - Create a pull request to the develop branch
   - Use the PR template to provide complete information
   - Link to any related issues

8. **Code Review Process**
   - Request reviews from appropriate team members
   - Address all feedback promptly
   - Re-request reviews after making changes

9. **Final Checks Before Merge**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Resolve all comments and change requests
   - Check that the feature meets acceptance criteria
   - Verify code coverage requirements are met

10. **Merge and Cleanup**
    - Merge the pull request to develop
    - Delete the feature branch
    - Update relevant documentation if needed

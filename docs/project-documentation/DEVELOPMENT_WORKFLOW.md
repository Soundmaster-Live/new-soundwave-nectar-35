# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow and processes for the SoundMaster Radio application.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd soundmaster-radio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables as described in the [Environment Setup](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) document.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules for code quality
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow component naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for React components
  - camelCase for functions and variables
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Component Development

1. **Create new components in their dedicated folders**
   ```
   src/components/feature-name/ComponentName.tsx
   ```

2. **Use TypeScript interfaces for props**
   ```typescript
   interface ButtonProps {
     variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
     size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
     children: React.ReactNode;
     onClick?: () => void;
   }
   
   export const Button = ({ 
     variant = 'primary', 
     size = 'md', 
     children, 
     onClick 
   }: ButtonProps) => {
     // Component implementation
   };
   ```

3. **Create custom hooks for reusable logic**
   ```typescript
   export const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
     
     const increment = () => setCount(prev => prev + 1);
     const decrement = () => setCount(prev => prev - 1);
     const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);
     
     return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
   };
   ```

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch from `main`**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement changes and commit regularly**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Push branch and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```
   Then, create a pull request on GitHub.

4. **Address review comments**
   Make requested changes, commit, and push again.

5. **Merge to `main` once approved**
   Once the pull request is approved, it can be merged to the `main` branch.

### Code Review Guidelines

#### For Authors
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix
- Include clear descriptions of what changed and why
- Reference related issues or tasks
- Self-review your code before submitting
- Respond to feedback promptly

#### For Reviewers
- Be constructive and respectful in comments
- Look for both correctness and maintainability
- Check for adherence to project standards
- Verify that tests cover the changes
- Approve only when all concerns are addressed

## Build and Deployment

### Building the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the [Deployment Options](./DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) document.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Unit tests are implemented using Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### End-to-End Testing
E2E tests are implemented using Cypress:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Component Testing
Test individual components with Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Verify authentication flows (signup, login, logout)
- Test audio streaming functionality
- Verify AI broadcaster responses
- Test admin dashboard functionality
- Verify responsive design on different devices

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

1. **Linting**: Checks code style and formatting
2. **Type checking**: Verifies TypeScript types
3. **Unit tests**: Runs Jest tests
4. **Build**: Ensures the application builds correctly
5. **E2E tests**: Runs Cypress tests on the built application

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor application performance with these tools:

1. **Lighthouse**: Run performance audits in Chrome DevTools
2. **React Profiler**: Identify performance bottlenecks in components
3. **Network tab**: Monitor API calls and response times
4. **Google Analytics**: Track user interactions and page load times

## Debugging

### Browser DevTools
- Use React DevTools to inspect component hierarchies
- Use Redux DevTools to inspect state changes
- Use the Network tab to debug API calls
- Use the Console for logging and error messages

### Error Monitoring
- Check browser console for errors
- Use error boundaries to catch and display component errors
- Implement error reporting to track production errors

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments
- Document props with TypeScript interfaces
- Add comments explaining non-obvious logic

### Project Documentation
- Update README.md with new features and changes
- Document API changes in the API Reference
- Keep environment setup instructions current

## How to Use These Updates

The updated features are immediately available in the application. The streaming functionality now uses the correct URL, and the AI assistant is powered by Google Gemini with Cloudflare Workers AI as fallback. The interface has been enhanced for better user experience across all devices.

When using the AI broadcaster:
1. The system automatically attempts to connect to Google Gemini first
2. If Gemini is unavailable or the API key is invalid, it seamlessly falls back to Cloudflare AI
3. Even if both providers fail, the system provides appropriate fallback messages
4. Users can manually reconnect by clicking the refresh button if needed

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Click the "Reconnect" button in the AI broadcaster
4. Check the console for detailed error logs
5. Contact support if issues persist

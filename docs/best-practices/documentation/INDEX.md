## Using These Guides

Each document focuses on a specific aspect of documentation. Developers should review all guides relevant to their work to ensure consistent documentation across the project.

## Documentation Philosophy

Good documentation should:

1. Be clear and concise
2. Explain "why" not just "what"
3. Be kept up-to-date with code changes
4. Be accessible to developers of all experience levels
5. Include examples where appropriate

Remember that documentation is a critical part of the development process, not an afterthought.

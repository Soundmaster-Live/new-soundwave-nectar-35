# Architecture Documentation Best Practices

## Component Relationships

1. **Document component relationships**
   ```markdown
   ## Component Architecture
   
   The application uses a layered component approach:
   
   1. **Page Components** - Top-level components corresponding to routes
   2. **Feature Components** - Implement specific features or sections
   3. **UI Components** - Reusable interface elements
   
   ### Data Flow
   
   ```
   App (State)
     ↓
   Page Components (Route-specific logic)
     ↓
   Feature Components (Business logic)
     ↓
   UI Components (Presentation)
   ```
   
   ### State Management
   
   - Local component state for UI concerns
   - Context API for shared state (authentication, theme)
   - TanStack Query for server state
   ```

2. **Create architectural diagrams**
   - Include diagrams that show the high-level architecture
   - Document the relationship between major components
   - Use visual aids for complex architectural concepts

   ```markdown
   ## Application Architecture
   
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Client Browser] --> B[React Frontend]
     B --> C[API Layer]
     C --> D[Database]
     C --> E[External Services]
     
     subgraph Frontend
       B --> F[UI Components]
       B --> G[State Management]
       B --> H[Routing]
     end
     
     subgraph Backend
       C --> I[Authentication]
       C --> J[Business Logic]
       C --> K[Data Access]
     end
   ```
   
   The diagram above shows the main components of our application architecture.
   ```

3. **Document module boundaries**
   ```markdown
   ## Module Boundaries
   
   The application is divided into the following modules, each with clear responsibilities:
   
   ### Authentication Module
   
   **Responsibilities:**
   - User sign-up and login
   - Session management
   - Password reset
   - OAuth integration
   
   **Public API:**
   - `useAuth()` - Hook for authentication state and methods
   - `<AuthProvider>` - Context provider for authentication
   - `<ProtectedRoute>` - Route component requiring authentication
   
   **Does NOT handle:**
   - User profiles (managed by the User module)
   - Permissions (managed by the Authorization module)
   
   ### Content Module
   
   **Responsibilities:**
   - Content creation and editing
   - Content publishing workflow
   - Content categorization
   
   **Public API:**
   - `useContent()` - Hook for content operations
   - `<ContentEditor>` - Component for editing content
   - `<ContentList>` - Component for displaying content
   
   **Dependencies:**
   - Authentication Module (for author information)
   - Media Module (for embedding media in content)
   ```

## Design Decisions

1. **Document design decisions**
   ```markdown
   ## Design Decisions
   
   ### State Management Choice
   
   We chose TanStack Query over Redux for data fetching because:
   
   1. It provides built-in caching and synchronization
   2. Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux
   3. Handles loading and error states more elegantly
   
   ### Component Library
   
   We use Shadcn UI components because:
   
   1. They provide consistent design language
   2. They're highly accessible
   3. They integrate well with our design system
   
   ### API Strategy
   
   We chose a REST API over GraphQL for this project because:
   
   1. Team familiarity with REST
   2. Simpler caching strategy
   3. Better tooling support in our ecosystem
   
   In the future, we may consider adopting GraphQL for specific features that would benefit from more flexible data fetching.
   ```

2. **Document trade-offs**
   ```markdown
   ## Architecture Trade-offs
   
   ### Client-Side Rendering vs. Server-Side Rendering
   
   **Decision:** We chose Client-Side Rendering for this application.
   
   **Pros:**
   - Better perceived performance after initial load
   - Reduced server load
   - Simpler deployment architecture
   
   **Cons:**
   - Longer initial load time
   - More complex SEO strategy required
   - Higher client device requirements
   
   **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Implementing code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
   - Using meta tag generation for SEO
   - Adding loading indicators for better UX
   
   ### Monolith vs. Microservices
   
   **Decision:** We started with a monolithic architecture.
   
   **Pros:**
   - Simpler development workflow
   - Easier debugging
   - Lower operational complexity
   
   **Cons:**
   - Limited independent scaling
   - Potential for larger codebase to become unwieldy
   
   **Future Considerations:**
   - We've designed the codebase with clear module boundaries to facilitate breaking out microservices if needed in the future
   - The authentication system is designed to be extracted first if needed
   ```

3. **Document performance considerations**
   ```markdown
   ## Performance Considerations
   
   ### Frontend Performance
   
   Our architecture addresses frontend performance through:
   
   1. **Code Splitting**
      - Route-based code splitting reduces initial load time
      - Dynamically loaded components for infrequently used features
   
   2. **Bundle Optimization**
      - Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
      - Minification and compression
      - Efficient dependency management
   
   3. **Rendering Optimizations**
      - Memoization of expensive components
      - Virtualization for long lists
      - Lazy loading of images and other resources
   
   ### API Performance
   
   Our API architecture includes:
   
   1. **Caching Strategy**
      - Response caching for frequently accessed data
      - Cache invalidation based on resource changes
      - Optimistic UI updates to reduce perceived latency
   
   2. **Query Optimization**
      - Pagination for large data sets
      - Field selection to limit response size
      - Batch operations for related changes
   
   3. **Background Processing**
      - Queue-based architecture for time-consuming operations
      - Webhooks for handling asynchronous processes
      - Real-time updates using WebSockets for active users
   ```

## Directory Structure

1. **Document directory structure**
   ```markdown
   ## Directory Structure
   
   ```
   /src
     /components     # Reusable UI components
       /ui           # Basic UI components
       /forms        # Form-related components
       /layouts      # Layout components
     /features       # Feature-specific code
       /auth         # Authentication feature
       /profile      # User profile feature
     /hooks          # Custom React hooks
     /contexts       # React context providers
     /utils          # Utility functions
     /api            # API integration code
     /types          # TypeScript type definitions
     /pages          # Page components
     /styles         # Global styles
   ```
   
   ### Key Directories
   
   #### /components
   
   Contains reusable UI components structured by function. Each component typically includes:
   - The component file (ComponentName.tsx)
   - Tests (ComponentName.test.tsx)
   - Types (if extensive, in types.ts)
   - Specialized hooks (useComponentName.ts)
   
   #### /features
   
   Feature-focused directories that encapsulate all code related to a specific feature:
   - Components
   - Hooks
   - Utils
   - Types
   - Context providers
   
   #### /hooks
   
   Global hooks that are used across multiple features:
   - Data fetching hooks
   - UI utility hooks
   - Browser API hooks
   
   #### /contexts
   
   Global context providers for state that spans the application:
   - Authentication context
   - Theme context
   - Notification context
   ```

2. **Document code organization principles**
   ```markdown
   ## Code Organization Principles
   
   Our codebase follows these organizational principles:
   
   ### 1. Feature-Based Organization
   
   Code is primarily organized by feature rather than by technical role.
   
   **Do:**
   ```
   /src/features/user-management/
     components/
     hooks/
     utils/
     types.ts
   ```
   
   **Don't:**
   ```
   /src/components/
   /src/hooks/
   /src/utils/
   ```
   
   ### 2. Co-location of Related Code
   
   Files that change together should be located together.
   
   **Do:**
   ```
   /src/features/checkout/
     CheckoutForm.tsx
     useCheckoutForm.ts
     validationSchema.ts
     types.ts
   ```
   
   **Don't:**
   ```
   /src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx
   /src/hooks/useCheckoutForm.ts
   /src/utils/validationSchema.ts
   /src/types/checkout.ts
   ```
   
   ### 3. Clear Module Boundaries
   
   Features should have clear APIs and minimize dependencies on other features.
   
   **Do:**
   - Export only what's needed from a feature
   - Use index.ts files to define public APIs
   - Minimize cross-feature dependencies
   
   **Don't:**
   - Directly import internal components from other features
   - Create circular dependencies between features
   ```

3. **Document naming conventions**
   ```markdown
   ## Naming Conventions
   
   Consistent naming helps maintain a readable and predictable codebase.
   
   ### Files and Directories
   
   - **Component files:** PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
   - **Hook files:** camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`, `useFormSubmit.ts`)
   - **Utility files:** camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `validationUtils.ts`)
   - **Test files:** Same name as the file they test with `.test` or `.spec` suffix
   - **Type files:** Either `types.ts` within a component directory or PascalCase for global types
   - **Context files:** PascalCase with 'Context' suffix (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx`)
   
   ### Components
   
   - **Component names:** PascalCase, descriptive of purpose
   - **Container components:** Often suffixed with 'Container' (e.g., `ProfileContainer`)
   - **Higher-order components:** Prefixed with 'with' (e.g., `withAuthentication`)
   - **Render props components:** Often prefixed with 'Render' (e.g., `RenderUserData`)
   
   ### Functions and Variables
   
   - **Functions:** camelCase, verb phrases describing action
   - **Boolean variables:** camelCase, prefixed with 'is', 'has', 'should' (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
   - **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for truly constant values
   - **Event handlers:** camelCase, prefixed with 'handle' (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `handleInputChange`)
   ```
